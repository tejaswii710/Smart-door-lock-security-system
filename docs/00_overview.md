## Overview

The **Smart Door Lock Security System** is a digital locking solution that enhances access control using a **Raspberry Pi** as the central controller. This project integrates a **4x4 matrix keypad**, **16x2 I2C LCD display**, **relay module** and **buzzer** to create a secure, interactive system for door access.

Users can unlock the door by entering a **predefined PIN** through the keypad. If the entered PIN is correct, the system triggers the **relay module** and provides confirmation through the LCD and buzzer. If the PIN is incorrect, the system denies access and sounds the buzzer multiple times as a warning.

This project offers a **low-cost**, scalable alternative to traditional locks, with potential for enhancements like camera surveillance, or integration with IoT platforms for remote monitoring.

Ideal for homes, labs, and secured areas, this system ensures safety and user-friendly access.
